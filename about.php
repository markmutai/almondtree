                The Indian Almond Tree in full growth provides solace from
                natural elements like the sun, wind &amp; rain; its leaves are a
                mix of green &amp; dark red, &amp; the actual almond seed is hard
                &amp; green in colour – difficult to get through but possible to
                break. The Almond Tree Wellness Center originated from this
                concept where a single tree provides refuge for many &amp;
                sometimes talking about sensitive issues are difficult but
                very possible, with the right approach.
