                Obtaining an informed consent form is necessary to ensure that you are aware of the
                treatment being offered. Since each individual reacts differently to therapy, it is not
                possible to predict all risks and reactions.
                <br>
                <br>
                By submitting this informed consent form:
                I understand that the treatments being provided to me or the person named below for whom
                I am legally responsible to may include:

                I also understand that a session lasts 45 to 90 minutes and follow-up sessions will be
                recommended after the first initial visit. For effective recovery it is advised to have
                6-9 visits, depending on the client need.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am aware of the risks outlined above and have discussed any concerns I may have
                regarding my therapy. I do not expect the counsellor to be able to anticipate and
                explain all possible risks and complications of treatment, and I wish to rely on the
                counsellor to exercise judgement during the course of treatment which they think at the
                time, based upon the facts then known is in my best interest. I understand results are
                not guaranteed.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am consenting to the treatments offered by Catherine Holden or by her fellow
                counsellors and to treatments recommended by them as well. I have been told about the
                risks and have had an opportunity to ask questions.
